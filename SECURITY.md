Failure to follow these policies when reporting a vulnerability, if applicable, may lead to being temporarily or permanently banned from contributing to this project.

## Supported Versions
These are the currently supported versions of NLine.

As a general policy, where possible:

## Security Vulnerabilities
Where it is possible to report a security vulnerability privately within the github page of one of my projects, please use this approach.

If it is not possible please email me at ``oss@alastair.mozmail.com`` with the subject line of "[Project Name] Potential Security Vulnerability", where [Project Name] is the name of the GitHub project.

Regardless of the method used to communicate the vulnerability, please ensure information about the potential vulnerability is contained within the report!

I will attempt to provide acknowledgement of receipt of the report shortly after receiving it/being notified of it. 

It may take a few days to investigate the issue and subsequently decide how to handle the potential vulnerability if is accepted as one.

Whilst a vulnerability is being investigated, please do not publish details about the vulnerability.

### Disclosure of the Vulnerability
A Security Vulnerability affecting one of my projects should not be publicly disclosed until and unless all of the following criteria apply:
1. The security vulnerability has been accepted as being a legitimate vulnerability.
2. The vulnerability has been fixed in an update to the project.
3. The updated version of the project has been distributed and made available to all platforms supported for at least 24 hours at the time of the vulnerability being discovered.
4. At least 24 hours has passed since the updated version of the project has been distributed.
5. The affected versions of the project have been de-listed or marked as containing a security vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
